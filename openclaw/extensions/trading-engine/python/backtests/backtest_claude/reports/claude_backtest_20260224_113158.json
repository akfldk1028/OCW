          "reasoning": "BTC is the most resilient of the three — only -0.12% on the 4h vs -1.12% and -1.30% for ETH/SOL. 24h trend is positive (+1.76%), funding rate is neutral at 0.0000 (no crowded longs to squeeze), and no extreme positioning signals. However, regime is 'ranging' so I'm keeping this small (10% = ~$500) as an exploratory starter position. Incomplete derivatives data (N/A CVD/L/S) limits conviction — sizing down accordingly. Reserve 90% cash for better-defined entries."

The 4h candle shows +0.95% recovery, but this may be a dead-cat bounce off intraday lows. Regime has shifted from 'ranging' to 'trending', which could be confirming a downward trend rather than an upward one given the 24h -2.02%. Funding rates at 0 offer no directional bias. No RL posterior data to weigh signal reliability. Waiting for either a decisive reclaim of $83K+ (invalidates breakdown) or a flush to the $79-80K zone for a better risk/reward entry."

          "reasoning": "ETH is showing notable relative strength vs BTC (+0.13% 24h vs BTC's -2.02%), and has the strongest 4h momentum at +1.32%. This is interesting — could reflect rotation or ETH-specific demand. However, BTC weakness historically drags ETH down with a lag, and entering here risks catching a falling knife if BTC accelerates lower. ETH vol at $37,434 is elevated (vs BTC's $2,747) suggesting genuine activity, but without CVD/L/S data I can't confirm whether this is buying or selling pressure. ETH becomes a genuine long candidate above $1,950 with BTC stability, or at $1,750-1,800 support on a BTC-driven flush."

No compelling entry case — SOL tends to be a high-beta play and in a potential downtrend it will underperform. Pass for now."
