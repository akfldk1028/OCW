          "reasoning": "Ranging regime with mild 4h weakness (-0.12%). Positive 24h (+1.76%) is encouraging but insufficient to overcome the ranging classification. Critical: CVD_ratio and L/S_zscore are both N/A \u2014 I'm flying without two of the most important derivatives signals. Zero funding rate means no leverage overhang to trade against. Without RL posteriors or trade history, I cannot validate which signal types are reliable. BTC ~$83.5K may be mid-range; need to identify range boundaries before committing capital."

Despite positive 24h (+0.96%), the 4h divergence from BTC suggests ETH is not leading. High volume ($52K) without directional derivative data makes this ambiguous. Ranging regime + no CVD = no conviction for a long."

          "reasoning": "SOL has the strongest 24h return (+1.99%) but the worst 4h print (-1.30%) \u2014 a divergence that often signals a mean-reversion pullback within a range. Very high volume ($426K) is notable but without CVD we cannot determine if that volume is buying or selling pressure. Ranging regime is hostile to momentum entries. Watching for SOL to find support and confirm trend before entering."
