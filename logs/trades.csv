BTC z-score of -3.21 confirms deep oversold condition that triggered this wake. 4h momentum has turned slightly positive (+0.28%), suggesting local exhaustion of selling. Funding rate at 0.0000 means no crowded longs to unwind — clean slate for longs. $307.4B stablecoin supply is massive dry powder. Position kept at minimum (5%) due to: (1) ALL TS signals below 40% reliability, (2) suspicious $0 volume data across all pairs (data quality concern), (3) high_volatility_unknown combined regime — double uncertainty. This is a toe-in contrarian position, not a full conviction trade.",high_volatility_unknown,claude,0.38,True
2026-02-24 08:42:07,BUY,BTC/USDT,63363.4700,0.259290,16429.53,0.0000,0.0,"Executing the contrarian starter position outlined in my previous note. BTC at $63,363 is essentially unchanged from my planned entry at $63,375 — the thesis is intact. Fear & Greed at 8/100 (Extreme Fear) is historically a strong mean-reversion signal over multi-day horizons. 4h price action shows stabilization (+0.26%) after a -4.30% 24h decline, suggesting short-term exhaustion. All TS signals are below 40% reliability, which caps position size at minimum 5% — no justification for anything larger in this fog of uncertainty. Hard stop at $61,500 remains valid (contrarian thesis breaks if we breach that level). Volume data showing $0 is a known feed anomaly — treating as a data quality issue, not a signal. Stablecoin supply at $307.4B represents significant sidelined capital that could support prices.",high_volatility_unknown,claude,0.42,True
